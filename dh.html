                      at Clean Seed, we’re driving our technology to make all that
                       data actionable. Our SMART Seeder MAX was designed to utilize that data
                      that can get down to the square-foot level and [empower] us to
                       essentially become a giant printer of seed and
                       inputs to grow the best crop at the lowest cost possible.

                      The agriculture sector is undergoing what is called a digital
                      revolution, and it’s all around our ability to grow more crops,
                      essentially worldwide, to feed a growing population. We have to
                       manage every square foot
                       of field a little bit differently than we have been.
